# KSBound: Kernel Stick-Breaking Prior Distribution for Spatial Boundary Detection

This package implements a hierarchical Bayesian Poisson regression analysis with nonparametric spatially correlated random effects useful for detecting boundaries in spatial data. The method relies on a discrete areal kernel function introduced within the kernel stick-breaking framework and is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Please see the "KSBound_Model_Details" and "KSBound_Example" folders for more specific information regarding the statistical model and package use details, respectively.
